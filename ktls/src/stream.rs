    ///
    /// Once a TLS `close_notify` alert from the peer is received, all subsequent
    /// read operations will return EOF.
    ///
    /// Once the caller explicitly calls `(poll_)shutdown` on the stream, all
    /// subsequent write operations will return 0 bytes, indicating that the
    /// stream is closed for writing.

    /// the peer automatically before shutting down the inner socket, according to
    /// [RFC 8446, section 6.1].
    ///
    /// The caller may call `(poll_)shutdown` on the stream to shutdown explicitly
    /// both sides of the stream. Currently, there's no way provided by this crate
    /// to shutdown the TLS stream write side only. For TLS 1.2, this is ideal since
    /// once one party sends a `close_notify` alert, *the other party MUST respond
    /// with a `close_notify` alert of its own and close down the connection
    /// immediately*, according to [RFC 5246, section 7.2.1]; for TLS 1.3, *both
    /// parties need not wait to receive a "`close_notify`" alert before
    /// closing their read side of the connection*, according to [RFC 8446, section
    /// 6.1].
